<h2><strong><strong>Message from the CMD&rsquo;s Desk</strong></strong></h2>
<p>We are amidst a highly competitive world, and it seeks greater transformative thinking and actions to stand out.</p>
<p>I take this opportunity to dig deeper into the
realm of possibilities. I take this opportunity
to act more and create another realm within our own periphery.</p>
<p>Each one of us has distinctive qualities to be reflected on the floor and we just need to put it into practise. When it gets reflected, it gets projected. When it gets projected, it gets notif ied and then people follow your flow. We are to work constantly on our core values and that is the key. We are to be committed to what our company wants from us and what best we can do for our company.</p>
<p>I am extremely proud and happy to publish the HR Manual of our Simpolo Group. This is indeed going to be a path maker for all of us.</p>
<p>This manual will create transparency in every step we take hereon. This manual will create a stronger bond and inclusivity among all.</p>
<p>I urge all my Simpolians to be honest and
devoted in following all that is directed
through this manual.</p>
<p>Simpolo is synonymous to innovation, and innovation is a by-product of instincts and talent. It is thus, an urge to the future talent to have their instincts projected. The youth of tomorrow will always have their dream reflected at Simpolo and we will be happy to have a spread of talent on the floor of Simpolo.</p>
<p>I wish you all a healthy, successful and a
long-lasting association with the Simpolo Group.</p>
<p>May the almighty give all of us the power to prove ourselves and move ahead in every endeavour, to make our group proud.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><strong>About Simpolo</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Simpolo has had a very long journey in the industry and stands atop its contemporaries like a shining star radiating its experience and sense of innovation.</p>

</ul>
<h2><strong><strong>Attendance Policy</strong></strong></h2>
<h3><strong><strong>Office Hours</strong></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>As per the standard operating procedures duly approved by the management, the office hours for the employees of different grades have been decided. The office time for women workers, office time for employees occupied with production activity, office hours for the employees working for commercial work and the senior grade employees like HODs and above have been decided separately. The office working hours have been analysed in the attendance policy with
thorough detailing.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Weekly off is basically a day during the week when the employee is not expected to work or take his work position at workplace.</li>
<p>A lot of organisations, including Simpolo have a work schedule of 24 hours and businesses running on the weekends too and hence, they don’t have the typical weekly off cycles. They may or may not have any fixed, but instead they’d be following a scheduled weekly off method every week. It is decided by the Simpolo Management that availing
week off is mandatory. If due to any emergency and need of the job, you are attending duty during your week off day then you must enjoy the week off on some other day as casual off during the same week, because rest is important for every category of workers.</p>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>A grace period is an extra amount of time on your shift timing in which you are free from certain consequences.</li>
<p>At Simpolo, a maximum of 15 minutes grace is given on 3 non-consecutive instances in a month on the rostered shift timing. Post that, it will be considered as late and every late coming in a month after that will be marked as a half day.</p>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Minimum working hours in a day to be considered for a half day, less than that will be marked as absent.
</li>
<p>For plant: Min. 6 hours</p>
<p>For office: Min. 5 hours</p>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong><strong>Biometric System: </strong></strong>We at Simpolo, strictly follow the biometric attendance tracking device and we highly recommend every employee to
register their thumb prints on the device when they login for their shift and when they logout of their shift daily, without fail as your salary calculation is directly linked to the biometric
attendance records.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong><strong>Gate Pass System: </strong></strong>With approval of the management, a gate pass system has been
adopted in the company. Employee is authorised to use four hours of time in a month without any charge for his/her personal use. This may be used at a time or more than one
time during the month. If the gate pass hours go beyond the approved time, then the extra hours consumed against gate pass will be deducted from the salary on an hour based calculation. For use of management approved four hours
against gate pass, a format has been approved. An employee can only use that format for use of the four hours against gate pass.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong><strong>Dress Code</strong></strong></h3>
<p>It is compulsory for all the employees to be in provided and prescribed uniform during everyday of
his/her duty hours. There is no provision extended for remaining in any form of casual wear on
odd days or on special day.</p>
<p>Maintaining uniformity is on priority in the company’s protocols and wearing a uniform during all working days is the first step to its adherence.</p>
<p>Employees working in the office (Non-Production Area Only) are given relaxation on Saturdays. They may come to office in casuals. For Production area, employees can come in casuals during Sundays.</p>
<h3><strong><strong>ID Card</strong></strong></h3>
<p>The employee shall always carry an ID card on him/her self when inside the company premises and present it while entering or leaving the company or on demand.</p>
<p>The ID cards shall be the property of the organisation and should be surrendered to the HR department on cessation/separation of employment.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Colony Allotment Policy</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Simpolo has its own accommodation facilities for the employees of different grades. Generally, the company allots accommodation to its employees as per terms and conditions, as decided during the interview. If during the interview, it is decided that quarter will be provided excluding the decided salary, if the quarter will be available, it will be provided to the newly joined employee without any charge.</p>
<p>If it is not promised during interview and employee needs a quarter, and if it is available with us, in that case quarter will be provided on chargeable basis. Each employee will be guided by the SOP of quarter allotment.</p>
